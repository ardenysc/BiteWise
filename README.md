# BiteWise (2023 NwHacks Hackathon)

### Description
BiteWise is a Chrome extesion that provides nutritional information when you are grocery shopping online.

I worked on the front-end to develop a dashboard page that displays nutritional statistics and graphs to help users make informed decisions about their food choices.

### Usage
Drag the product name and click on the BiteWise extension. It will provide you with the relevant nutritional information. (Please note that this feature is currently unfinished)
